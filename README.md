# PredictingWineFeatures

This project predicts the best features of wines that relate to wine quality. This MLOps pipeline uses a self-managed Digital Ocean Github action-runner, Data Version Control to manage data changes across pipeline stages, and Continuous Machine Learning (CML) to support continual integration metrics analysis of models across stages, experiments, and branches.
